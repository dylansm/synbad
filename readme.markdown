Cycle through file syntaxes in Vim using a list of predefined syntaxes.

Use case: you have a file that Vim thinks is HTML but you want to treat it as PHP or Liquid or ERB. Create a file at the root of your project called .syntaxes and enter file types in it:

```
html
php
javascript
liquid
```

Or, define global syntaxes in your .vimrc file:

```
let g:syntaxes = ['go', 'html', 'javascript', 'jsx', 'php', 'ruby', 'twig']
```

### Key mappings

Ctrl-y to cycle through file types. When you've cycled through the available options, ctrl-y will return to default filetype.
